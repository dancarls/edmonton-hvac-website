## **Why Winter HVAC Prep Matters in Edmonton**

Edmonton's winters don't mess around. When temperatures routinely plunge to -30°C to -40°C, your heating system becomes the difference between comfortable living and a potentially dangerous situation.

Your furnace works harder during Edmonton winters than in almost any other Canadian city. This extreme stress means maintenance isn't optional—it's essential for safety, comfort, and avoiding costly emergency repairs when you need heat most.

Home heating can account for over 60% of your winter energy bills in Edmonton. Proper winterization and regular maintenance can save you 5-15% on heating costs while preventing the system failures that lead to emergency repair bills averaging $350-$850 during peak winter months.

This guide provides a complete Edmonton furnace winterization checklist so you can prepare your HVAC system for Alberta's harsh winter conditions.





## **Edmonton Furnace & Heating System Winterization Checklist**

### **Book a Professional Annual Furnace Tune-Up**

Professional furnace maintenance in Edmonton isn't a luxury—it's a necessity given our extreme climate.

A comprehensive tune-up by a qualified HVAC technician catches potential problems before they become emergency breakdowns on the coldest night of the year.





**What Professional Tune-Ups Include:**

**Complete system inspection** checks all components for wear, damage, or impending failure

**Burner cleaning and adjustment** ensures efficient combustion and maximum heat output

**Heat exchanger examination** identifies cracks that could leak carbon monoxide

**Electrical connection testing** prevents dangerous shorts and system failures

**Blower motor and belt inspection** catches issues before they cause complete breakdowns

**Safety control verification** ensures your system shuts down properly if problems occur

**Efficiency testing** identifies issues costing you money on every heating cycle





Schedule your annual tune-up in September or early October before the rush. HVAC companies get overwhelmed once cold weather hits, and you don't want to wait weeks for service when temperatures drop.

Professional maintenance typically costs $150-$250 but can prevent emergency repairs costing hundreds or thousands more during winter.





### **Change Furnace Filters Regularly**

Your furnace filter is the simplest yet most critical maintenance task for Edmonton winters.

During heating season, filters trap dust, pet dander, and airborne particles—but they get dirty quickly when your system runs constantly in extreme cold.





**Edmonton Filter Change Schedule:**

**Every 1 month** - Homes with pets, allergies, or high dust

**Every 2 months** - Standard Edmonton homes during peak winter

**Every 3 months** - Minimal use periods (fall/spring)

Clogged filters force your furnace to work harder, increasing energy bills by up to 15% while reducing heat output when you need it most.

They also stress the blower motor, potentially causing premature failure that requires expensive repairs.





**Choosing the Right Filter:**

Standard fiberglass filters (MERV 1-4) provide basic protection

Pleated filters (MERV 8-12) improve air quality and last longer

HEPA filters (MERV 13+) capture smallest particles but may restrict airflow in some systems

Check your furnace manual for recommended filter specifications. Using too restrictive a filter can damage your system.

### **Test Thermostat and Carbon Monoxide Detectors**

Your thermostat controls when your furnace runs, while carbon monoxide detectors provide life-saving protection.

Both require testing before winter arrives.





**Thermostat Testing:**

Set temperature 5 degrees above current room temperature

Listen for furnace to start within a few minutes

Verify warm air flows from vents

Check that thermostat reading matches actual room temperature

Replace batteries if you have a programmable model





**Upgrade to Programmable or Smart Thermostats:**

Edmonton homeowners can save 10-30% on heating costs with proper thermostat programming.

Set lower temperatures when sleeping (16-18°C is comfortable under blankets)

Reduce heat when everyone's at work (15°C maintains pipes without wasting energy)

Program heat to increase 30 minutes before wake-up and arrival times

Smart thermostats learn your patterns and can be controlled remotely, preventing you from heating an empty house.





**Carbon Monoxide Safety:**

Test detectors monthly using the test button

Replace batteries twice yearly (daylight saving time changes are good reminders)

Replace entire units every 5-7 years regardless of function

Install detectors on every level of your home, especially near sleeping areas

Carbon monoxide risk increases with prolonged use of older or unmaintained heating systems. Alberta Health emphasizes that working detectors are non-negotiable for winter safety.





### **Seal Windows, Doors, and Insulate Problem Areas**

Edmonton's extreme temperature differences between inside and outside create enormous heat loss through gaps and poor insulation.

Every crack, gap, or poorly insulated area forces your furnace to work harder and costs you money on every heating cycle.





**Priority Sealing Areas:**

**Windows** - Add weatherstripping or replace if damaged. Consider plastic shrink film for single-pane windows

**Doors** - Install door sweeps and replace worn weatherstripping. Check that doors close tightly

**Electrical outlets** - Install foam gaskets behind outlet covers on exterior walls

**Attic access** - Ensure hatch is properly insulated and weatherstripped

**Basement rim joists** - Major heat loss area in older Edmonton homes. Add rigid foam insulation

**Ductwork** - Seal any accessible duct joints with mastic sealant





Proper sealing can reduce heating costs by 10-20% while making your home significantly more comfortable.

Edmonton's older neighborhoods with homes built before modern building codes see the biggest improvements from air sealing projects.





### **Clear and Inspect Vents, Registers, and Exhausts**

Edmonton's heavy snowfall creates unique challenges for HVAC systems.

Snow and ice can block critical intake and exhaust pipes, creating dangerous situations.





**Winter Vent Maintenance:**

**Keep snow cleared** from exterior furnace intake and exhaust pipes (usually white PVC pipes on house exterior)

**Check after every major snowfall** - Snow drifts can block vents within hours

**Inspect monthly** for ice buildup around exhaust terminations

**Remove furniture and drapes** blocking interior vents and returns

**Vacuum registers** to remove dust that reduces airflow





Blocked exhaust vents can cause carbon monoxide to back up into your home—a potentially fatal situation.

High-efficiency furnaces have intake and exhaust pipes that extend outside. In Edmonton's climate, these are vulnerable to snow and ice blockage.

After clearing snow from your driveway and walkways, always check these pipes. It takes two minutes and could save your life.





### **Consider Duct Cleaning and Chimney Inspection**

Indoor air quality matters more during Edmonton winters when homes stay sealed tight for months.

Duct cleaning removes accumulated dust, pet dander, and allergens that circulate through your home every time the furnace runs.





**When to Consider Professional Duct Cleaning:**

Recent home renovation creating construction dust

Visible mold growth inside ducts or on registers

Excessive dust throughout home despite regular cleaning

Family members experiencing increased allergies or respiratory issues

Rodent infestation in ductwork





Professional duct cleaning typically costs $300-500 but can significantly improve indoor air quality and system efficiency.

**If you have a fireplace or wood stove**, schedule professional chimney inspection and cleaning before winter. Creosote buildup poses serious fire risk, and blockages can allow dangerous gases into your home.





### **Emergency Preparedness for Winter Extremes**

Edmonton's winter can create situations where you lose heat despite proper maintenance.

Extreme cold snaps, power outages, and equipment failures happen. Being prepared prevents dangerous situations.





**Winter Emergency Kit:**

Extra furnace filters (keep 2-3 on hand)

Flashlights and batteries

Emergency contact numbers for HVAC service

Space heaters (CSA-approved only, never leave unattended)

Extra blankets and warm clothing

Non-perishable food and water

Battery-powered or hand-crank radio





**Emergency Contact Information:**

Keep your HVAC company's emergency number easily accessible

Know your utility company's outage reporting number

Have a backup plan if you need to evacuate during extreme cold

Check on elderly neighbors during cold snaps—heat loss can become life-threatening quickly





### **Monthly Maintenance and Monitoring Schedule**

Set reminders to check these items monthly throughout winter:





**Task**

**Frequency**

**Takes**

Check/replace filter

Monthly

2 minutes

Test carbon monoxide detectors

Monthly

1 minute

Clear snow from vents/intakes

After snowfall

5 minutes

Check thermostat batteries

Every 2 months
